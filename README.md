# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

![Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hello ðŸ‘‹


This is another simple css/html practice webpage I created part of the Frontend Mentor challenges.
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge.

Here is the [live result](bagaski.github.io/four-card-feature/)
